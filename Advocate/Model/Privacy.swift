Advocate respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. You may comfortably browse our app without giving us any information about yourself. Only when you file a claim may we need your personal information to provide services that you request, or you may have the option choose to provide us with your personal information. This policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

INFORMATION COLLECTION

When you browse our app, you do so anonymously. We do not collect personal information, including your email address. We do not log your IP address (the Internet address of your device) or track you in any way.

Advocate does not collect personal information when you register with with our software. If a file is claimed, Advocate may receive personal information from business partners and / or vendors. Advocate will only use such information if it has been collected in accordance with the privacy practices consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.

We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have acquired data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, that may be of interest to your case once a file has been claimed. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include:

-Address information about you from a third party source
-School, medical, legal, personal, or employment records
-Social media content

We only collect and retain information in defense of you and your case. At the conclusion of your case or at the conclusion of our relationship, which is at yours and our discretion, at any time, we destroy all information about you from our application, from our database(s).

PLATFORM DISCLOSURE

The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which a subscriber (a "Member") has engaged Advocate.

Advocate believes that you have the right to access your information. Advocate collects any and all information under the direction of its Members, and has no outside relationship with the Members whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our clients that use our service, please contact the client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our clients.

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data from one of our clients, should direct their query to Advocate's client. We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Members. Advocate will retain your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any and all disputes, and enforce our agreements throughout the duration of your case.

CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified on your claim application).

The end of this Privacy Policy will be the last updated date for our policy. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

Thank you for your patience,

David Oliver Doswell
